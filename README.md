=======

This repository contains the markdown and code for the Mastering Ionic course hosted on Thinkster.io. Pull requests are more than welcome for typos, code errors, etc :)

### Getting the base project set up
Navigate to the /code/ folder and run the command `npm install`. Then follow the rest of the course, starting at the section ["Starting our project"](https://thinkster.io/ionic-framework-tutorial/#starting-our-project).

### Need help?
Feel free to [shoot me a tweet](https://twitter.com/ericsimons40), or if you have [Thinkster Pro](https://thinkster.io/pro), I'm also available on the Pro Slack channel for one-on-one support.
